Build System
============

Tooling for JavaScript is not yet captured by a good set of tools yet. Jasy is one approach to fix this situation. Without a good and generic build system it's pretty hard to deal with even semi-complex project structures. In basically every other programming environment (.NET, Java, Objective-C or even Flash) it's typically to use a build system. Still it seems that in JavaSCript people think to be able to life without such a system.

Tooling systems which are based on a [DSL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) are often quite limited regarding flexibility. Jasy should be the one and only tooling solution for your JavaScript you need. There should not be anything you can't implement in there. This is one of the reasonings why the build system is not configured using a DSL. Instead Jasy is used through a Python3-API. The project author writes a Python3-script using the Jasy-API but is also able to use all standard Python modules to fulfill the tasks. 

Jasy is to some point comparable to the ideas also implemented in build systems like [SCons](http://www.scons.org/).
