Creating skeletons is pretty easy. Basically it's just a project where some names are replaced with variables and two optional files in it. A skeleton is copied 1:1 to the destination folder, then patches are being applied and a custom script is being executed.

## Placeholders

Every project can use place

## Automatic values

There are a few pre-defined fields available for your skeleton:

* `name`: 
* `jasy.version`
* `origin.name`: Name of the project which offered the skeleton
* `origin.version`: Version of the project offered the skeleton
* `origin.skeleton`: Name of the skeleton which was used

## Skeleton Specific Files

* jasycreate.yaml/json
* jasycreate.py

## Command Line Arguments
