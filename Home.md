Jasy - JavaScript Tooling Framework
===================================

Jasy combines a powerful Python3-based tooling environment with a small JavaScript library.

Essentially the tooling framework makes it easy to develop medium to large size JavaScript projects. It makes it easy to deal with external projects and resources to be used in your own project.

The JavaScript library support the core concepts of the build system like dealing with permutations and assets. It also comes with some other functionality like a full object orientation layer with classes and interfaces.
