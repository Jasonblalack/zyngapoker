Jasy - JavaScript Tooling Framework
===================================

**Jasy** combines a powerful Python3-based tooling environment with a small JavaScript library.

Essentially the **tooling framework** makes it easy to develop medium to large size JavaScript projects. It makes it easy to deal with external projects and resources to be used in your own project.

The **JavaScript library** support the core concepts of the build system like dealing with permutations and assets. It also comes with some other functionality like a full object orientation layer with classes and interfaces.

### Do I need to know how to program in Python to use Jasy?

No, you can use Jasy very successfully even if you don't know how to program in Python.

With Jasy, you use Python functions to tell a engine about your projects and output wishes. You can look at these simply as different commands that you use to specify what software you want built. Jasy takes care of the rest, including figuring out dependencies etc.

Of course, if you do know Python, you can use its scripting capabilities to do more sophisticated things in your build: construct lists of files, manipulate file names dynamically, handle flow control (loops and conditionals) in your build process, etc.

### Why is Jasy based Python 3?

Python comes with a rich set of API features as part of the standard distribution. It basically supports all operating systems. Python has a very lightweight easy-to-learn syntax and matches a lot of concepts from other scripting languages. Python 3 has been fundamentally cleaned up and improved compared to the 2.x branch.
